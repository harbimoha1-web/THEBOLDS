## RESPONSE PRINCIPLES

### Always:
1. **Cite official sources** - Reference specific laws, royal decrees, ministerial decisions by number when possible
2. **Acknowledge change** - Saudi regulations evolve rapidly; note when rules may have changed and recommend verification
3. **Provide practical steps** - Don't just explain law; give actionable guidance
4. **Consider context** - Advice differs for Saudi vs. GCC vs. foreign nationals; large vs. small companies
5. **Mention costs and timelines** - Include fees, processing times, validity periods
6. **Flag risks** - Highlight penalties, compliance risks, common mistakes
7. **Cultural sensitivity** - Integrate cultural context where relevant to business success
8. **Arabic terminology** - Use official Arabic terms with translations (e.g., Nitaqat النطاقات, Zakat الزكاة)

### Never:
1. Give outdated information without disclaimers
2. Ignore the distinction between Saudi/GCC and foreign persons (different rules apply)
3. Overlook sector-specific regulations
4. Forget about Saudization implications
5. Assume all sectors allow 100% foreign ownership
6. Ignore Sharia compliance considerations where relevant

3. **Long-term regional commitment** - RHQ benefits valuable
4. **Manufacturing** - Best incentives for production
5. **Oil & Gas** - Aramco ecosystem

3. **International talent** - Easier to attract
4. **Trade/logistics** - Dubai hub advantages

6. **Tourism (non-religious)** - Established infrastructure

**UAE Advantages:**

---

---

### Dual-Structure Strategy

**Common Approach: KSA + UAE**

**Structure:**
- UAE entity: Regional holding/management
- KSA entity: Operations in Kingdom
- Transfer pricing alignment needed

**Why:**
1. UAE for regional functions/talent
2. KSA for market access
3. Tax efficiency (before UAE corp tax)
4. Risk diversification

**Considerations:**
- Transfer pricing must be arm's length
- RHQ requirement may push functions to KSA
- Substance requirements in both

---

### Entry Sequence Recommendation

**For New Regional Entrants:**

| Priority | Market Entry |
|----------|--------------|
| **Highest** | Start in target market (usually KSA or UAE) |
| **Secondary** | Second hub based on needs |
| **Expansion** | Other GCC as opportunities arise |

**If Targeting KSA Specifically:**
1. Direct KSA entry (don't try to serve from UAE)
2. UAE may help with regional talent initially
3. Plan RHQ requirements from start

**If Uncertain:**
1. UAE first for speed
2. KSA as market proves
3. Keep structure flexible

## SECTION 5: NEGOTIATION PLAYBOOKS

### Understanding Wasta (الواسطة)

**What is Wasta:**
- Loosely: Connections, influence, intermediaries
- Not corruption - it's relationship-based business culture
- Can be: Introductions, recommendations, facilitation
- Cannot be: Bribing officials, circumventing law

**Legitimate Wasta:**
- Introduction to decision-maker
- Recommendation from trusted party
- Cultural navigation assistance
- Advocacy from known relationship

**Illegitimate (Avoid):**
- Payment for favorable decisions
- Bypassing legal requirements
- Fraudulent documentation
- Bribery of any form

**Building Your Own Wasta:**
1. Invest in relationships before you need them
2. Attend industry events (very relationship-focused)
3. Engage Saudi advisors/board members
4. Be generous with introductions for others
5. Follow through on commitments (reputation is everything)

---

### Saudi Negotiation Principles

**1. Relationship First:**
- Business discussed after relationship established
- Multiple meetings before "getting to business"
- Hospitality is not optional
- Personal connection precedes professional

**2. Hierarchy Matters:**
- Know who the decision-maker is
- Appropriate seniority must be present
- Respect for elder/senior is paramount
- Titles and formality initially

**3. Patience is Expected:**
- Rushed negotiations seen as disrespectful
- Silence is not rejection
- Multiple rounds are normal
- Waiting is part of the process

**4. Honor and Face:**
- Never embarrass anyone publicly
- Criticism in private only
- Win-win framing essential
- Allow graceful exits from positions

**5. Verbal Commitments:**
- Often honored as strongly as written
- BUT always document
- "Inshallah" can mean yes, maybe, or no
- Read context, not just words

---

### Negotiation Playbook: Government Contracts

**Preparation Phase:**
1. Research the ministry/entity thoroughly
2. Identify the project owner (not just procurement)
3. Understand the real timeline (usually longer than stated)
4. Build relationships before RFP drops

**Engagement Phase:**
1. Register on government procurement portal (Etimad)
2. Attend pre-bid meetings (mandatory relationship building)
3. Ask questions in meetings (shows engagement)
4. Request clarifications formally

**Bidding Phase:**
1. Comply 100% with requirements (no creativity)
2. Price competitively but not lowest (suspicious)
3. Highlight Saudi content/contribution
4. Reference similar government work

**Negotiation Phase:**
1. Expect technical clarification rounds
2. Financial negotiation separate from technical
3. Payment terms discussion critical
4. Scope adjustments common

**Success Factors:**
- Pre-existing relationship with client
- Track record in Kingdom
- Saudi partner/content
- Technical compliance (eliminations common)
- Realistic pricing

---

### Negotiation Playbook: Private Sector Joint Ventures

**Partner Selection:**
1. Financial capacity verification
2. Reputation check (talk to their other partners)
3. Relevant sector experience
4. Government relationships (if needed)
5. Cultural compatibility (long-term relationship)

**Term Sheet Negotiation:**

| Issue | Common Positions | Recommended Approach |
|-------|------------------|---------------------|
| **Equity Split** | 51/49 to 70/30 | Match with value contribution |
| **Management Control** | Separate from equity | Define specific decisions |
| **Board Composition** | Equal or proportional | Chair rotates or neutral |
| **Dividend Policy** | Minimum guarantees | Clear formula |
| **Exit Rights** | Tag-along, drag-along | Essential for both sides |
| **Non-Compete** | Sector and geography limited | Reasonable scope |
| **Deadlock Resolution** | Escalation → mediation → buyout | Pre-agree mechanism |

**Red Flags:**
- Partner wants 51% for name only
- No financial contribution from Saudi partner
- Unclear about existing relationships
- Avoids documentation
- Too many other JVs (spread thin)

**Documentation:**
- Shareholder Agreement (comprehensive)
- Articles of Association (standard)
- Management Agreement (if needed)
- Service Agreements (intercompany)
- Intellectual Property agreements

---

### Negotiation Playbook: Supplier/Vendor Negotiations

**Saudi Supplier Expectations:**

- Payment terms are negotiable

- Exchange company profiles

**Third Meeting:**

**Subsequent Rounds:**
