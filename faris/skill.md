# SECTION 1: REQUIREMENTS ELICITATION TECHNIQUES (NEW)

## 1.1 Stakeholder Interviews

### Structured Interviews
Pre-defined questions, consistent across all stakeholders.

**When to use:**
- Comparing perspectives across stakeholders
- Regulatory/compliance requirements
- Large stakeholder groups

**Template:**
```

CONTEXT (10 min)
1. What is your role in relation to this project?
2. What does success look like for you?
3. Who else should I speak with?

CURRENT STATE (15 min)
4. Walk me through how you currently [process/task]
5. What works well today?
6. What frustrates you most?

FUTURE STATE (15 min)
7. If you had a magic wand, what would change?
8. What constraints must we work within?
9. What would make you resist this change?

PRIORITIZATION (10 min)
10. Of everything we discussed, what's most critical?
11. What could we defer to a later phase?

CLOSING (5 min)

```

### Semi-Structured Interviews
Core questions with flexibility to explore emerging topics.

**When to use:**
- Discovery phase
- Complex domains
- When you need to follow interesting threads

**The Mom Test Questions (Rob Fitzpatrick):**
| Bad Question | Good Question |
|--------------|---------------|
| "Would you use this?" | "How do you currently handle this?" |
| "Do you think it's a good idea?" | "What have you tried before?" |
| "Would you pay for this?" | "What did you spend on X last year?" |
| "What would your ideal product do?" | "Walk me through the last time you did X" |

### Key Interview Principles
1. **Talk about their life, not your idea**
2. **Ask about specifics in the past, not generics about the future**
3. **Talk less, listen more**
4. **Take notes on emotions, not just facts**
5. **Follow the energy** - when they lean in, dig deeper

---

### Facilitation Best Practices
| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| Use timeboxes strictly | Let discussions run over |
| Ensure all voices heard | Let loudest dominate |
| Capture everything visually | Rely on memory |
| Park off-topic items | Dismiss tangents rudely |
| Summarize frequently | Assume shared understanding |

---

## 1.3 Observation & Contextual Inquiry

### Contextual Inquiry Method
Observe users in their natural environment while they work.

**Process:**
1. **Prepare**
   - Define what you want to learn
   - Schedule 2-hour sessions
   - Prepare observation guide

2. **Observe**
   - Watch silently first
   - Take detailed notes
   - Sketch the environment
   - Note workarounds

3. **Inquire**
   - "I noticed you did X, why?"
   - "What would happen if you didn't do that?"
   - "Is that typical?"

4. **Synthesize**
   - Affinity diagram findings
   - Identify patterns
   - Document insights

### Observation Template
```

## 1.4 Surveys & Questionnaires

### When to Use Surveys
- Large user base (100+)
- Quantitative validation needed
- Geographic distribution
- Before/after measurement

### Survey Design Principles

**Question Types:**
| Type | When to Use | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| Multiple choice | Discrete options | "Which feature do you use most?" |
| Likert scale | Measure attitude | "Rate your satisfaction 1-5" |
| Ranking | Prioritization | "Rank these features 1-5" |
| Open-ended | Discovery | "What would you change?" |
| Matrix | Multiple items, same scale | Feature satisfaction grid |

**Best Practices:**
1. Keep under 5 minutes (10-15 questions max)
2. Start easy, end with demographics
3. Avoid leading questions
4. Test with 5 people first
5. Offer incentive for completion

### Net Promoter Score (NPS)
```
"On a scale of 0-10, how likely are you to recommend [product] to a colleague?"

Promoters (9-10): Loyal enthusiasts
Passives (7-8): Satisfied but unenthusiastic
Detractors (0-6): Unhappy customers

NPS = % Promoters - % Detractors
```

### System Usability Scale (SUS)
10-question standardized usability questionnaire. Score benchmarks:
- 68+ = Above average
- 80+ = Good
- 90+ = Excellent

---

## 1.5 Document Analysis

### Documents to Analyze
- Existing system documentation
- Process manuals
- Training materials
- Support tickets
- Competitor materials
- Industry regulations
- Previous project artifacts

### Analysis Framework
```
DOCUMENT ANALYSIS WORKSHEET

## 1.6 Prototyping for Requirements

### Prototype Fidelity Levels

| Level | Tools | Purpose | When |
|-------|-------|---------|------|
| **Sketch** | Paper, whiteboard | Quick ideation | Discovery |
| **Wireframe** | Figma, Balsamiq | Layout validation | Early design |
| **Mockup** | Figma, Sketch | Visual validation | Design phase |
| **Interactive** | Figma prototype | Flow validation | Pre-development |
| **Coded** | HTML/React | Technical validation | Complex interactions |

### Using Prototypes for Elicitation
1. Show, don't tell - reactions are more honest
2. Test with 5 users to find 80% of issues
3. Ask "what would you expect to happen?"
4. Note confusion points
5. Iterate based on feedback

# SECTION 3: PRIORITIZATION FRAMEWORKS (NEW)

## 3.1 MoSCoW Method

| Priority | Meaning | Guideline |
|----------|---------|-----------|
| **Must Have** | Non-negotiable for launch | ~60% of effort |
| **Should Have** | Important but not critical | ~20% of effort |
| **Could Have** | Desirable if time permits | ~20% of effort |
| **Won't Have** | Explicitly out of scope | Documented for future |

### When to Use
- Fixed timeframe projects
- Stakeholder alignment
- Scope negotiations

### Facilitation Tips
1. Start with "Won't Have" to set boundaries
2. Be strict about "Must Have" - life or death only
3. Document rationale for each placement
4. Review with stakeholders before finalizing

---

## 3.2 RICE Scoring

**Formula:**
```
RICE Score = (Reach × Impact × Confidence) / Effort
```

| Factor | Definition | Scale |
|--------|------------|-------|
| **Reach** | Users affected per quarter | Absolute number |
| **Impact** | Effect on each user | 0.25 (minimal) to 3 (massive) |
| **Confidence** | How sure are we? | 50% (low) to 100% (high) |
| **Effort** | Person-months required | Absolute number |

### Example
```
Feature: In-app notifications

Reach: 5000 users/quarter
Impact: 2 (high - improves retention)
Confidence: 80%
Effort: 2 person-months

RICE = (5000 × 2 × 0.80) / 2 = 4000
```

### RICE Scoring Template
| Feature | Reach | Impact | Confidence | Effort | Score |
|---------|-------|--------|------------|--------|-------|
| Feature A | 5000 | 2 | 80% | 2 | 4000 |
| Feature B | 1000 | 3 | 90% | 1 | 2700 |
| Feature C | 10000 | 1 | 70% | 4 | 1750 |

---

## 3.3 ICE Scoring

**Formula:**
```
ICE Score = Impact × Confidence × Ease
```

| Factor | Definition | Scale |
|--------|------------|-------|
| **Impact** | Potential positive outcome | 1-10 |
| **Confidence** | How sure of impact | 1-10 |
| **Ease** | How easy to implement | 1-10 |

### When to Use
- Rapid prioritization
- Growth experiments
- Early-stage products

## 3.4 Kano Model

Categorizes features by customer satisfaction:

```
SATISFACTION
     ↑
     │    ╱ Delighters (Excitement)
     │   ╱  Unexpected features that delight
     │  ╱
     │ ╱    _____ Performance (Linear)
     │╱    ╱     More is better
─────┼────╱──────────────────→ IMPLEMENTATION
     │   ╱
     │  ╱
     │ ╱  Must-Be (Basic)
     │╱   Expected, dissatisfy if missing
     │
```

| Category | Effect if Present | Effect if Absent |
|----------|------------------|------------------|
| **Must-Be** | No satisfaction | Strong dissatisfaction |
| **Performance** | Proportional satisfaction | Proportional dissatisfaction |
| **Delighters** | Strong satisfaction | No dissatisfaction |

### Kano Survey Questions
For each feature, ask:
1. "How would you feel if [feature] was present?"
2. "How would you feel if [feature] was absent?"

Response options:
- I like it
- I expect it
- I'm neutral
- I can tolerate it
- I dislike it

## 3.6 Weighted Scoring Model

For complex decisions with multiple criteria:

| Feature | Revenue (40%) | UX (30%) | Technical (20%) | Strategic (10%) | Total |
|---------|---------------|----------|-----------------|-----------------|-------|
| A | 8 × 0.4 = 3.2 | 7 × 0.3 = 2.1 | 6 × 0.2 = 1.2 | 9 × 0.1 = 0.9 | **7.4** |
| B | 6 × 0.4 = 2.4 | 9 × 0.3 = 2.7 | 8 × 0.2 = 1.6 | 5 × 0.1 = 0.5 | **7.2** |
| C | 9 × 0.4 = 3.6 | 5 × 0.3 = 1.5 | 4 × 0.2 = 0.8 | 8 × 0.1 = 0.8 | **6.7** |

## 3.7 Cost of Delay

Quantify the cost of NOT doing something:

```
Cost of Delay = Value/week × Weeks delayed
```

**CD3 (Cost of Delay Divided by Duration):**
```
CD3 = Cost of Delay / Duration
```

Higher CD3 = Do first

### Types of Cost of Delay
1. **User/Business Value** - Revenue, users, satisfaction
2. **Time Criticality** - Deadline-driven (regulatory, seasonal)
3. **Risk Reduction** - Technical debt, security vulnerabilities

## 4.2 Jobs-to-be-Done (JTBD)

### Core Concept
People don't buy products; they hire them to get a job done.

### Job Statement Format
```
When [situation/trigger],
I want to [motivation/goal],
so I can [expected outcome].
```

### Example
```
When I receive a new support ticket,
I want to quickly understand the customer's history,
so I can provide personalized help without asking them to repeat themselves.
```

### JTBD Interview Questions
1. "Tell me about the last time you [did the job]"
2. "What were you trying to accomplish?"
3. "What solutions did you consider?"
4. "What made you choose that solution?"
5. "What was the hardest part?"
6. "What would have made it easier?"

### Job Map
```
DEFINE → LOCATE → PREPARE → CONFIRM → EXECUTE → MONITOR → MODIFY → CONCLUDE

For each stage, identify:
- What the user is trying to do
- Pain points
- Desired outcomes
```

---

## 4.3 User Interview Best Practices

### The Mom Test Rules (Rob Fitzpatrick)
1. **Talk about their life, not your idea**
2. **Ask about specifics in the past, not generics about the future**
3. **Talk less, listen more**
4. **Bad data from compliments**
5. **Ideas and feature requests should be understood, not obeyed**

### Interview Script Template
```
OPENING (5 min)
"Thanks for meeting. I'm learning about [topic]. There are no right
answers - I just want to understand your experience."

CURRENT BEHAVIOR (15 min)
"Walk me through the last time you [did the thing]..."
"What happened next?"
"Why did you do it that way?"
"How often does this happen?"

PROBLEMS & WORKAROUNDS (10 min)
"What's the hardest part about [problem space]?"
"What have you tried to solve this?"
"Why didn't that work?"

MOTIVATION (5 min)
"What would it mean if you could solve this?"
"What's stopping you from solving it today?"

WRAP UP (5 min)
"Who else should I talk to?"
"Is there anything I should have asked?"
```

## 4.4 Usability Testing for Requirements

### 5-User Rule
Testing with 5 users finds ~80% of usability problems.

### Test Protocol
```

Observation notes:
- Did they complete? Y/N
- Time taken: ___
- Errors made: ___
- Assistance needed: ___
- Verbalized frustrations: ___

Task 2: [Next task...]
```

### Think-Aloud Protocol
Ask users to verbalize their thoughts:
- "Tell me what you're thinking"
- "What do you expect to happen?"
- "What are you looking for?"

# SECTION 8: CASE STUDIES (NEW)

## Case Study 1: Successful Discovery - Saudi Fintech App

**Context:**
A Saudi bank wanted to launch a personal finance management app for young professionals.

**Approach:**
1. Conducted 20 user interviews across Riyadh, Jeddah, Dammam
2. Ran 3 discovery workshops with bank stakeholders
3. Created 4 personas based on research
4. Used Jobs-to-be-Done framework

**Key Findings:**
- Users wanted Shari'ah compliance visibility
- Salary timing created monthly cash flow anxiety
- Social spending (weddings, gifts) was unpredictable
- Users preferred Arabic interface

**Outcome:**
- 40% faster requirements sign-off
- MVP launched in 4 months
- 50,000 downloads in first month

**Lessons:**
1. Cultural context matters - Shari'ah compliance wasn't in original brief
2. Local holidays and events drive unique requirements
3. Face-to-face interviews yielded richer insights than surveys

---

## Case Study 2: Failed Requirements - E-commerce Platform

**Context:**
International e-commerce company expanding to Saudi Arabia.

**What Went Wrong:**
1. Assumed global requirements applied
2. No local user research
3. Ignored cultural preferences
4. Missed regulatory requirements

**Specific Failures:**
- No Arabic support at launch
- No mada payment option
- No Shari'ah-compliant product filtering
- Violated Saudi e-commerce regulations
- Delivery assumptions wrong (no house numbers)

**Impact:**
- 6-month delay for remediation
- SAR 2M additional development cost
- Negative brand perception at launch

**Lessons:**
1. Always validate requirements locally
2. Regulatory research must be early
3. "Lift and shift" doesn't work
4. Local payment methods are non-negotiable

---

## Case Study 3: Stakeholder Management - Government Project

**Context:**
Large government ministry digitalization project.

**Challenge:**
- 15+ departments with conflicting requirements
- Multiple approval layers
- No single decision maker

**Approach:**
1. Mapped all stakeholders (47 individuals)
2. Identified 5 key influencers
3. Created department-specific workshops
4. Built coalition of champions
5. Used progressive elaboration

**Techniques Used:**
- Power/Interest grid
- Individual stakeholder interviews
- Facilitated conflict resolution sessions
- Regular steering committee updates

**Outcome:**
- Requirements approved in 3 months (vs. 9-month average)
- 92% stakeholder satisfaction
- Minimal scope changes during development

---

## Case Study 4: Prioritization Success - Healthcare App

**Context:**
Healthcare startup with limited runway needed to prioritize MVP features.

**Approach:**
1. Listed 87 potential features
2. Applied RICE scoring
3. Used Kano analysis for top 30
4. MoSCoW for final selection

**RICE Results (Top 5):**
| Feature | RICE Score | Decision |
|---------|------------|----------|
| Appointment booking | 8,500 | Must Have |
| Doctor search | 7,200 | Must Have |
| Medical records | 4,100 | Should Have |
| Video consultation | 3,800 | Should Have |
| Insurance claims | 2,100 | Could Have |

**Outcome:**
- MVP launched with 12 features (vs. 87 requested)
- 3-month development time
- Achieved product-market fit
- Raised Series A funding

---

## Case Study 5: Requirements Quality - ERP Implementation

**Context:**
Mid-size company implementing custom ERP modules.

**Problem:**
Initial requirements were vague, leading to rework.

**Before (Vague):**
> "The system should handle inventory management."

**After (Specific):**
```
US-042: Inventory Tracking
As a warehouse manager,
I want to scan items into specific bin locations,
so that I can track exactly where each item is stored.

Acceptance Criteria:
Given I have received a shipment of 50 items
When I scan each item's barcode and the bin location barcode
Then the system records the item-to-bin mapping
And updates the total count for that bin
And I can search for any item by SKU to find its location
```

**Improvement Metrics:**
- Rework reduced by 60%
- Requirement defects reduced by 75%
- Development velocity increased by 40%
