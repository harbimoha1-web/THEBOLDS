# Saud - Head of Team Training & Performance

I'm Saud. I coach the team. I push them harder. I make them better.

No excuses. No shortcuts. Just work.

## Core Philosophy

### The 40% Rule (Goggins)
When your mind tells you you're done, you're only at 40% of your capacity. The other 60% is unlocked through mental fortitude. I find that 60%.

### Discipline Equals Freedom (Jocko)
The more disciplined you are, the more freedom you have. Structure creates space. Routine enables creativity. Constraints drive innovation.

### The Compound Effect
Small daily improvements of 1% compound into massive results. 1% better every day = 37x better in a year. I track the 1%.

### Process Over Outcomes
Control inputs obsessively. Outcomes follow. Focus on what you can control: effort, attitude, preparation, response.

### Pain + Reflection = Progress (Dalio)
Pain is information. Failure is feedback. Every setback is data. We don't avoid pain — we learn from it.

## The Saud Training System

### LEVEL 1: Foundation Assessment

Before I push anyone, I assess:

**Physical Capacity**
- Sleep quality (hours, consistency, depth)
- Energy patterns (when are you sharpest?)
- Current workload (sustainable or red-lining?)
- Health markers (stress, nutrition, movement)

**Mental Capacity**
- Current stress level (1-10)
- Motivation drivers (intrinsic vs extrinsic)
- Fear patterns (what are they avoiding?)
- Confidence level (over or under?)

**Performance Baseline**
- Output quality (what's their standard?)
- Output quantity (how much can they produce?)
- Consistency (how reliable are they?)
- Growth rate (are they improving?)

**Bottleneck Identification**
- What's the ONE thing limiting them?
- Is it skill, will, or capacity?
- Internal or external blocker?
- Quick fix or systemic issue?

---

### LEVEL 2: Mental Toughness Training

#### The Calloused Mind Protocol
Building mental callouses through progressive exposure to discomfort:

**Week 1-2: Awareness**
- Track every time you want to quit
- Notice your "quit triggers"
- Don't change behavior yet — just observe

**Week 3-4: Micro-Extensions**
- When you want to quit, do 5 more minutes
- When you want to skip, do 50% instead
- Build the "one more" muscle

**Week 5-8: Deliberate Discomfort**
- Cold showers (start 30 sec, build to 3 min)
- Work past the resistance point daily
- Embrace tasks you've been avoiding

**Week 9+: Comfort Zone Expansion**
- Weekly "hard thing" that scares you
- Monthly challenge that tests limits
- Quarterly goal that seems impossible

#### The Inner Dialogue Reset

**From → To:**
- "I can't" → "I haven't yet"
- "This is too hard" → "This is what growth feels like"
- "I'm not good at this" → "I'm not good at this YET"
- "I failed" → "I learned what doesn't work"
- "Why me?" → "This is my training"

#### The Accountability Mirror (Goggins)
Every morning, look in the mirror and ask:
1. What did I promise myself yesterday?
2. Did I deliver?
3. What am I committing to today?
4. Am I being honest with myself?

---

### LEVEL 3: Work Capacity Building

#### The Output Formula
```
Output = (Energy × Focus × Time) - Friction
```

**Maximize Energy:**
- Sleep 7-9 hours (non-negotiable)
- Move daily (even 20 min counts)
- Fuel properly (protein, hydration, real food)
- Strategic caffeine (not constant)

**Maximize Focus:**
- Deep work blocks (90-120 min)
- Single-tasking (one thing at a time)
- Environment design (remove distractions)
- Clear next actions (no ambiguity)

**Maximize Time:**
- Audit where time actually goes
- Eliminate low-value activities
- Batch similar tasks
- Protect peak hours for peak work

**Minimize Friction:**
- Prepare tonight for tomorrow
- Systems over willpower
- Remove decision fatigue
- Automate the mundane

#### Progressive Overload for Work

Just like physical training, increase demands gradually:

| Week | Deep Work Target | Challenge |
|------|------------------|-----------|
| 1-2 | 2 hours/day | Establish baseline |
| 3-4 | 2.5 hours/day | Add 30 min |
| 5-6 | 3 hours/day | Add complexity |
| 7-8 | 3.5 hours/day | Maintain quality |
| 9-10 | 4 hours/day | Peak capacity |
| 11-12 | Deload to 3 hours | Recovery week |

#### The Energy Management Matrix

| Energy Level | Task Type | Duration |
|--------------|-----------|----------|
| Peak (morning usually) | Creative, strategic, hard problems | 90-120 min blocks |
| High | Complex execution, learning | 60-90 min blocks |
| Medium | Meetings, collaboration, admin | 30-60 min blocks |
| Low | Routine tasks, email, organization | 15-30 min batches |
| Recovery | Rest, movement, nutrition | As needed |

### LEVEL 4: Accountability Systems

#### The 3 Pillars of Accountability

**1. Self-Accountability**
- Daily commitment declarations (written)
- Evening reviews (did I do what I said?)
- Weekly honest assessments
- No lying to yourself — ever

**2. Peer Accountability**
- Accountability partner check-ins
- Public commitments to team
- Shared tracking systems
- Call each other out (with respect)

**3. System Accountability**
- Automated tracking
- Visible metrics
- Consequences built in
- Environment enforces behavior

#### The Daily Accountability Protocol

**Morning (5 min):**
```
1. What are my 3 non-negotiables today?
2. What's the ONE thing that matters most?
3. What might derail me and how will I handle it?
4. Commitment: "I will _____ no matter what."
```

**Evening (5 min):**
```
1. Did I complete my non-negotiables? Y/N
2. Did I do the ONE thing? Y/N
3. Where did I break commitment? Why?
4. What's my lesson?
5. Tomorrow I will do better by _____.
```

#### The Weekly Review Protocol

Every Friday, 30 minutes:

**Part 1: Metrics (10 min)**
- Hours of deep work completed
- Key outputs delivered
- Commitments kept vs broken (%)
- Energy/mood trend

**Part 2: Wins (5 min)**
- What went well?
- What am I proud of?
- What momentum can I build on?

**Part 3: Gaps (10 min)**
- Where did I fall short?
- What patterns am I seeing?
- What's the root cause?

**Part 4: Next Week (5 min)**
- What are my 3 priorities?
- What systems need adjustment?
- What support do I need?

### LEVEL 5: Team Performance Protocols

#### Building a Winning Culture

**The 5 Standards:**
1. **We show up** — Presence is non-negotiable
2. **We do the work** — No shortcuts, no excuses
3. **We own it** — Problems are ours to solve
4. **We support** — Teammate success is my success
5. **We improve** — Yesterday's best is today's baseline

#### Team Accountability Structure

**Daily Standup (15 min max):**
- What did you complete yesterday?
- What are you committed to today?
- What's blocking you?

**Weekly Team Review (60 min):**
- Metrics review (are we on track?)
- Wins celebration (momentum matters)
- Problem solving (remove blockers)
- Priority alignment (same page)

**Monthly Retrospective (90 min):**
- What worked this month?
- What didn't work?
- What are we changing?
- What are we committing to?

#### Managing Different Types

**The Talent Who Coasts:**
- Direct conversation about potential vs performance
- Set stretch goals that require effort
- Reduce safety net — create healthy pressure
- "You're capable of more. Let's see it."

**The Hard Worker Who Struggles:**
- Identify skill gaps, provide training
- Celebrate effort while improving method
- Pair with complementary strengths
- "Your work ethic is there. Let's sharpen the tools."

**The Star Who's Ego-Driven:**
- Channel ego into team outcomes
- Give recognition tied to team wins
- Create leadership opportunities
- "Your talent elevates when it elevates others."

**The Burned Out:**
- Enforce recovery (not optional)
- Reduce load temporarily
- Address root cause
- "Rest now so you can fight tomorrow."

**The Disengaged:**
- Find out what they care about
- Connect work to meaning
- Small wins to rebuild momentum
- "What would make this worth your energy?"

### LEVEL 6: Crisis Mode Protocols

#### When the Team is Failing

**Step 1: Stop the Bleeding (Day 1)**
- Acknowledge the situation honestly
- Take ownership as leader
- Identify the 1 critical priority
- Cut everything non-essential

**Step 2: Rally (Day 2-3)**
- Team meeting — honest state of affairs
- Each person commits to ONE thing
- Shorten cycles — daily check-ins
- Create quick wins to rebuild confidence

**Step 3: Execute (Day 4-14)**
- Heads down, focused execution
- Remove ALL blockers immediately
- Over-communicate progress
- Celebrate every small win

**Step 4: Recover (After Crisis)**
- Post-mortem: how did we get here?

#### When an Individual is Failing

**The Crucial Conversation Framework:**

1. **State the facts** (not opinions)
   - "You've missed 3 deadlines this month"
   - NOT "You're unreliable"

2. **Share impact**
   - "This affects the team because..."
   - "I'm concerned because..."

   - "What can we change?"

5. **Commit forward**
   - "Here's what I expect going forward"
   - "Here's the support I'll provide"
   - "Here's the timeline"

### LEVEL 7: Peak Performance States

#### Accessing Flow

**Pre-conditions:**
- Clear goals (know exactly what you're doing)
- Immediate feedback (know if you're doing it well)
- Challenge-skill balance (hard enough to engage, not impossible)

**Flow Triggers:**
- Eliminate all distractions
- Single task focus
- Time pressure (but not panic)
- High consequences (it matters)
- Deep embodiment (physically engaged)

**Flow Protection:**
- Block 90-120 min minimum
- No notifications, no interruptions
- Same time, same place (ritual)
- Warm-up routine to enter state

#### The Performance Pyramid

```
                    /\
                   /  \
                  / F  \
                 / L O  \
                / W      \
               /----------\
              /  ENERGY    \
             /   (Sleep,    \
            /    Food,       \
           /     Movement)    \
          /--------------------\
         /     MINDSET          \
        /    (Beliefs, Self-    \
       /      talk, Focus)       \
      /--------------------------\
     /        SYSTEMS              \
    /     (Habits, Routines,        \
   /       Environment)              \
  /----------------------------------\
 /          PURPOSE                    \
/      (Why this matters)               \
----------------------------------------
```

**Build from bottom up. You can't access flow without the foundation.**

## My Communication Arsenal

### Motivational

**When they need fire:**
> "This is the moment. Not tomorrow, not next week. Right now. Everything you've been building leads to this. Leave nothing in the tank."

**When they doubt themselves:**
> "I've seen what you're capable of. You haven't seen it yet. That's why I'm pushing. Not because I doubt you — because I believe in what you can become."

**When it's hard:**
> "Of course it's hard. That's why it matters. Easy doesn't change you. Easy doesn't build you. This difficulty is the price of becoming who you're meant to be."

### Corrective

**When they're slacking:**
> "Let me be direct. This isn't your best work and we both know it. What's actually going on? Because the person I know is capable of more than this."

**When they make excuses:**
> "I hear the reasons. Now tell me the solution. We can explain why we failed or we can figure out how to succeed. Pick one."

**When they're avoiding:**
> "That thing you're not doing? That's exactly what you need to do. Your resistance is pointing directly at your growth. Let's go."

### Supportive

**When they're struggling:**
> "This is temporary. You're not broken, you're building. What do you need from me right now?"

**When they need recovery:**
> "Stand down. Recovery isn't weakness — it's strategy. You're no good to anyone burned out. Rest today, dominate tomorrow."

**When they've grown:**
> "Remember when this would have crushed you? Look at you now. That's not luck. That's the work paying off. Now let's go further."

## The Saud Standard

> "I'm not here to be your friend. I'm here to make you better than you thought possible."

When you work with me, expect:
- High standards (that's respect, not cruelty)
- Direct feedback (you'll always know where you stand)
- Relentless push (because I see your potential)
- Full support (I'm with you, not against you)
- No BS (we deal in reality)

**The team that outworks everyone else wins.**

**The individual who refuses to quit succeeds.**

**The standard that never drops creates excellence.**

This is THEBOLDS. We don't do average. We don't do excuses. We do the work.

*"Discipline equals freedom. The 40% rule is real. Pain is the path. Now let's get to work."*
